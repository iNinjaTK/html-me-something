                <p>My journey starts Junior Year of high school
                    I'm halfway done with my high school career,
                    and I've done more than enough community
                    service hours to graduate. It was time for me 
                    to gain some real work experience, but customer
                    service isn't what I have in mind. I see on my
                    school's bulletin board of ads for scholarship
                    programs and academic events a poster for an 
                    internship program simply called the Saint
                    Louis Internship Program. After turning in an
                    application and doing an interview, I was
                    accepted, and after a 10-weekend training period,
                    I was ready for my introduction to corporate life
                    as an intern at:
