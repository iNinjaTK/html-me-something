            <p>My journey starts Junior Year of high school
                    I'm halfway done with my high school career,
                    and I've done more than enough community
                    service hours to graduate. It was time for me 
                    to gain some real work experience, but customer
                    service isn't what I have in mind. I see on my
                    school's bulletin board of ads for scholarship
                    programs and academic events a poster for an 
                    internship program simply called the Saint
                    Louis Internship Program. After turning in an
                    application and doing an interview, I was
                    accepted, and after a 10-weekend training period,
                    I was ready for my introduction to corporate life
                    as an intern at:

            <h3>Thompson Coburn - Summer 2012</h3>
                <p>This was the first company I was ever employed under.
                    Thompson Coburn is a law firm with a location in the
                    downtown area of St. Louis at the time. It's possible
                    to call me a Legal Intern during this time, but there
                    was only so much I can do as a high school intern
                    who wasn't focused in studying law more so than he 
                    was just looking for a summer job. I perform all sorts
                    of clerical duties you would expect a high school student
                    can only do: sorting files, digitizing case archives,
                    printing copies, etc. During my time here under the 
                    SLIP, I was given an opportunity
                    to carry out a mock trial where I and a group of other
                    law firm interns get together, choose sides, argue for
                    sides in a court case, and determine who carried out their
                    defense the best. That would be a highlight of my
                    summer that year.

            <h3>PARIC Corporation - Summer 2013</h3>
                <p>
                    Another school year goes by. I graduate high school. I 
                    return to the SLIP to request
                    for one last summer internship before heading off to
                    college at Saint Louis University. PARIC Corporation was
                    my assigned company for that year, which is a construction
                    company that was responsible for many of the construction
                    project I only started to learn about throughout the
                    Saint Louis city and county areas. I continued performing
                    my clerical duties throughout my time there rotating from
                    department to department at the company. I was ready to
                    finish what would have been my last summer internship
                    before college when I suddenly received a call.

                <p>During my Senior Year of high school before I graduated and
                    began my internship at PARIC, I applied for the Emma Bowen
                    Foundation on a whim. A nationally-recognized program that 
                    targets college students interested in media and guarantees
                    four summer internships upon acceptance? Count me in! Though 
                    I had little hope that I would get in, I received my acceptance 
                    call during my internship period at PARIC and they wanted me 
                    to start immediately?! Crazy! So I had to call the SLIP 
                    Program Directors and tell them the great news but also my
                    unfortunate premature end to the internship at PARIC. My 
                    two-week notice was filed, and although they didn't like 
                    to hear it, my program directors were generous and understood
                    how great the opportunity I had before me was. July of that
                    summer would begin my first internship at Charter Communications.

            <h3>Charter Communications - IT Management - Summer 2013</h3>
                <p>After my time at PARIC, I moved on to Charter Communications as 
                    an IT intern. Though I still haven't started my college years
                    yet, my new managers still wanted me to have some sort of
                    foundational knowledge in tech and the management of the 
                    business process before starting school. During my time here,
                    in addition to performing the usual clerical duties, I also 
                    took the time to study the software development life cycle
                    and the business process management workflow, though I would 
                    never apply my knowledge until much later in my college years.
                    At last, my Freshman Year of college at Saint Louis University
                    begins.

            <h3>Charter Communications - Network Engineering - Summer 2014</h3>
                <p>I was on a Computer Science craze Freshman year, taking as 
                    many computer science and programming classes as possible 
                    without any regard for my gen-ed classes like natural sciences
                    or literature. I return to Charter for my second summer 
                    internship and I hit a slump. As a rotational program, they
                    place me with the Network Engineering team I couldn't retain
                    anything. Studying network connections had little meaning to 
                    me. In addition, my managers were too busy with their own
                    projects to give me any work of my own other than generic
                    reading assignments of network operations. I would spend the 
                    rest of that summer starting and finishing House M.D. during 
                    work hours (that's bad, don't do that).
                </p>
            <h3>Spectrum Reach - Marketing and Creative Services - Summer 2015</h3>
                <p>Sophomore Year came and went. Computer Science was progressing
                    faster than I can retain and comprehend. I could no longer
                    keep my grades up, and I saw a trend that was spiraling
                    downward. I made a preemptive strike on my work ethic and 
                    switched to an IT Management major in the business school. 
                    Returning to Charter for a third time, I was more ready than
                    ever to not repeat my mistakes from last year. Dabbing at my
                    creative side and my minor in Film Studies, I spend a majority
                    of my summer working with the marketing and creative services 
                    department that dealt with creating and displaying advertisements
                    on Charter's TV networks. Though it was also somewhat slow,
                    I felt I was making more progress and learning more this
                    summer than last summer at the very least.

            <h3>Charter Communications - Human Resources - Summer 2016</h3>
                <p>Junior Year flashed before my eyes. I was fast approaching 
                    Senior Year, and I was beginning to doubt my future. I 
                    started wanting to learn to code again, but the coding 
                    courses required for my major only dabbled in it. Just enough
                    to give me a somewhat weak foundation in programming. My 
                    summer internship in Human Resources didn't help to quell 
                    my doubts either. However, I made the most of it. Operating 
                    more in email distribution and spreadsheet generation, I
                    did anything I could to apply programming to the Excel
                    spreadsheets I generated, whether it was as simple as 
                    short computation, to long form absolute references to 
                    specific cells. Either way, my Senior Year is coming fast,
                    and, reflecting on my resume until now, I felt no closer to
                    being ready for the workforce in IT post-graduation than 
                    I was last year.

            <h3>Charter Communications - IT Management - Summer 2017</h3>
                <p>My four years of college are up. My four summer internships
                    at Charter through the Emma Bowen Foundation are up. 
                    Anticipating a potential gap in work after graduation, 
                    I applied for a Charter summer internship through Charter's 
                    own website. Using my resources from the Emma Bowen Foundation 
                    and the managers I knew at Charter during my times there, I 
                    was able to return for one truly final internship with Charter 
                    in a department directly related to my career. During my time 
                    in the IT Intake team, I learned the process for taking in 
                    requests for application updates or changes. I learned how to 
                    solicit business requirements from requestors, and convey 
                    those thoughts into reality. Needless to say, I learned more
                    about my field in this summer internship period than I did 
                    throughout my four-year rotational period during college. 
                    Although my team had no room to bring me on as a full-time 
                    employee, my hiring manager used her resources to help me 
                    network with Brooksource, a contracting company that specializes
                    in placing recent college graduates in IT roles throughout 
                    Saint Louis. After countless trial and error with interviews, 
                    Brooksource successfully placed me at Express Scripts, where 
                    I currently am today. And hopefully, LaunchCode will be 
                    responsible for the next step in my career.
